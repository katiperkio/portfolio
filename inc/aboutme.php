  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi! My name is Kati Perki√∂ and I am here to tap into my creative side
    via the vast world of web design. I am currently based in Vantaa,
    Finland.

    I have been studying full-stack development in Business College
    Helsinki since August 2023. <br />
    This portfolio was initially made by me as a part of the studies, but
    I ended up loving it so much that I decided to keep it as is for what
    is to come.
